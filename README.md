# cryptoprediction
Machin learning algorithmes to predict cryptocurrencies prices.

In this project, we highlight the effectiveness of certain type of machin learning algorithms applied to the price prediction of cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, we found it interesting to accompany the code with a report describing the hidden sides of such a project, namely: how to go about properly recovering cryptocurrency data and storing it? What can we expect from a predictive algorithm? And finally, what is the minimum level of precision required to be able to build an almost certainly profitable trading strategy?

No special instruction, run the code on jupyter without modifying the variables.
The data is given in the March2019 file which regroups the prices, volumes, transaction of the BNB / USDT pair.
